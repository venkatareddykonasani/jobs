# Understanding Job Scams: A Guide for Fresh Graduates and Job Seekers

The issue of job scams is becoming increasingly prevalent, particularly targeting fresh graduates and job seekers from tier 2 and tier 3 cities. This summary aims to shed light on the common scams encountered by job seekers and offers advice on how to avoid falling victim to these fraudulent schemes.

#### Common Job Scams

1. **CV Score Scam**: Fraudsters contact job seekers, claiming to improve their CV's visibility to employers for a fee, promising an enhanced CV score. This scam usually requests an amount ranging from 2,000 to 5,000 INR.

2. **Fake Interview Fees**: Scammers ask for money, typically between 5,000 and 10,000 INR, to schedule interviews. Legitimate companies do not charge candidates for interviews.

3. **Paid Training Scam**: After conducting seemingly genuine interviews, scammers offer a job with the condition that the candidate pays for training. The fees demanded can be substantial, from 15,000 to 50,000 INR.

4. **Backdoor Job Offer Scam**: Individuals claim they can secure a job for a hefty fee, often in the lakhs. These offers are fraudulent, and victims discover too late that the job does not exist.

5. **Video Call Blackmail Scam**: In more severe cases, scammers engage in a video call with the candidate, act inappropriately, and then threaten to release the recorded video unless a ransom is paid. This scam targets both freshers and experienced professionals, demanding large sums of money under the threat of public exposure.

#### Avoiding Scams: Key Advice

- **No Upfront Payments**: Genuine companies do not require payments from candidates, whether for job application, interviews, training, or any other hiring process.
  
- **Awareness and Education**: Job seekers, especially those from less urban areas, need to be educated about these scams. They should be skeptical of any job offer that requires payment or seems too good to be true.

- **Community Support**: Experienced professionals should mentor and guide less experienced job seekers, sharing knowledge about these scams and how to avoid them.

- **Reporting Scams**: Victims or witnesses of job scams should report these incidents to authorities or higher officials to help prevent others from falling victim.

#### Other Job Scams

1. **Fake Jobs on Social Media**: Scammers often use social media platforms to reach potential victims with seemingly attractive job offers. These offers may come from accounts with low follower counts or duplicate profiles, suggesting they are not legitimate

2. **Job Scams on Verified Job Sites**: Even on reputable job boards like Indeed, Monster, or CareerBuilder, fraudulent job postings can appear. These listings may seem legitimate but could involve non-existent jobs that never pay or request upfront payments

3. **Job Placement Service Scams**: Here, scammers pose as recruitment or staffing agencies offering to secure employment for a fee. Legitimate job placement services are typically paid by employers, not job seekers

4. **Work-From-Home Job Scams**: With the allure of remote work, scammers post fake job listings that require upfront fees for training, certifications, or supplies, leading to financial loss without job provision

5. **Part-time Job Scam**: Specifically targeting the youth with tasks like data entry and content writing, these scams lure victims with small commissions and persuade them to invest for bigger returns, only for the scammers to vanish after receiving significant amounts.

6. **Impersonation and Sextortion**: These involve the misuse of personal information or the creation of fake identities to extort money from victims, often underreported due to the sensitive nature of the crimes
